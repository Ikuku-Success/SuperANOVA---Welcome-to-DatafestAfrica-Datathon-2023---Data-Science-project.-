# SuperANOVA---Welcome-to-DatafestAfrica-Datathon-2023---Data-Science-project.-

## Overview
`Our online payment platform processes millions of transactions daily, making it vulnerable to various types of fraudulent activities. These activities pose a significant threat to both our business and our customers. To safeguard our platform and enhance user experience, we aim to leverage the power of data science and machine learning to proactively detect and prevent fraudulent transactions.`

## Objectives
We are required to build an advanced machine learning model to predict whether a given transaction is potentially fraudulent or not. This model will be vital for real-time decision-making, allowing us to flag and investigate suspicious activities promptly. The primary aim is to enhance the security of our platform. By identifying fraudulent transactions early, we can take preventive measures to protect our customers and our business from financial losses. Fraud detection directly impacts the trust our customers have in our platform. Accurate and efficient detection of fraudulent activities assures our users that their transactions are safe and secure. Implementing automated fraud detection reduces the manual effort required for monitoring transactions, allowing our business to operate more efficiently.
